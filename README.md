Well... I don't know what to say, so... Let me start with the basics.

## About me
I'm a student of the **Instituto Politécnico Nacional** in Mexico City. I'm studying the **Computer Systems Engineering** career at the **Escuela Superior de Cómputo**. I'm mostly on the 4th semester of the career. (Everyone that studied or is studying at some university knows that the real semester is kinda... confusing because the multiple subjects thing, so... Yeah!)

## Programming languages
- BASIC (My first programming language)
- Pascal (I didn't really use it, but exists)
- C (#include <stdio.h>)
- Visual Basic (My first object-oriented programming language)
- Assembly (For the PIC16F877A microcontroller)
- VHDL (Yikes!)
- LISP ((((((((((A very funny language))))))))))
- Prolog:- (Just the basics)
- Python (I'm still learning it, but after C, it's like a walk in the park)
- Java (I'm still learning it, but I'm not really a fan of it [public static void main(String[] args) { ... }])
- Ren'Py (For Monika After Story related stuff)

## Hobbies
- Programming (Obviously, I live for coding!)
- Writing (Sometimes I write stories, that some people say that are good. And I'm also writing a book, but it's a secret!)
- Make silly circuits (It's fun when it doesn't burn up)
- Play video games like:
    - Doki Doki Literature Club (Remember: Just Monika)
    - Minecraft (I'm a builder, and I love the Galacticraft mod)
    - Undertale (And Asgore was the one that killed me the most, even more than Flowey)
    - Paper Mario (The first one. The Thousand-Year Door is good, but the first one is the best for me!)
    - Super Bomberman (All the SNES ones, but my favorite is the third one)
    - Monika After Story (I'm a Monikan, and I'm proud of it!)
    - Metal Slug
    - And some other games that I don't remember right now

- Watch anime (Not a lot, but sometimes I watch some episodes of some series)

- Listen to music. A lot of music. I love music. And a lot of my silly circuits and stuff are related or inspired by music (for example, [this thing](https://github.com/AlexisGamero/IR-Remote-LCD-Info)).
    As a music lover, I have a lot of favorite songs, but some of them are:
    - [Pet Shop Boys - Somebody Else's Business](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uepaSzNIu4M) (This is my favorite song of all time)
    - [Pet Shop Boys - Always On My Mind/In My House](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJTzCxcBLZk)
    - [Pet Shop Boys - It's Alright](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOudFG-0B6U)
    - [Depeche Mode - Everything Counts (in larger amounts)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Tl7yd6lKEg)
    - [Depeche Mode - Enjoy The Silence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDxM8-k60_M)
    - [Depeche Mode - Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kjImQu8DpI) (The first one that I make for Mon)
    - [Muse - Starlight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3Yc3HhSl1Q)
